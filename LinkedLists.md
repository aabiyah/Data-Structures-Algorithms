# Linked Lists & Solving LeetCode Questions

## Basics of Linked Lists:
1. **Definition**: A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are linked using pointers.
2. **Types**:
   - **Singly Linked List**: Nodes point to the next node.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes point to both the next and previous nodes.
   - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the head.
3. **Key Operations**:
   - **Traversal**: Visit each node sequentially. `O(n)`
   - **Insertion/Deletion**:
     - At Head/Tail: `O(1)`
     - At Middle: `O(n)` (requires traversal)
   - **Search**: Find a node. `O(n)`

## Steps to Solve Linked List Problems:
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - Identify input/output (head of the list, modified list, etc.).
   - Check constraints (e.g., length, duplicates, sorted).

2. **Think Through Examples**:
   - Use small lists to simulate operations manually.

3. **Choose an Approach**:
   - Use pointers (`current`, `prev`, `next`) to navigate.
   - Use recursion for reverse or divide-and-conquer problems.

4. **Write Code**:
   - Create helper functions if needed (e.g., `findMiddle`, `reverseList`).
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., empty list, single node).

5. **Test**:
   - Test with provided examples.
   - Add edge cases (e.g., null head, one element, cyclic lists).

## Common Techniques:
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use slow/fast pointers for middle detection or cycle detection.
   - Example: Detect a cycle in a linked list.

2. **Reverse a Linked List**:
   - Use iterative (prev, current, next) or recursive methods.

3. **Merge Two Lists**:
   - Use a dummy node for simpler merging logic.
   - Example: Merge two sorted linked lists.

4. **Split and Merge**:
   - Divide the list into halves (find middle) and merge back.
   - Example: Sort a linked list.

5. **Recursive Solutions**:
   - Use recursion for divide-and-conquer or reversing.
   - Example: Reverse nodes in k-group.

## Example LeetCode Questions:
1. **Reverse Linked List**:
   - Use iterative or recursive approach.

2. **Linked List Cycle**:
   - Use Floydâ€™s cycle detection algorithm (two pointers).

3. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**:
   - Use a dummy node and merge step-by-step.

4. **Remove Nth Node From End**:
   - Use two pointers to find the node efficiently.

5. **Sort List**:
   - Use merge sort with recursion.

6. **Reorder List**:
   - Split the list, reverse the second half, and merge alternately.

## Tips:
- **Initialization**: Start with `head` and necessary pointers (`current`, `prev`).
- **Edge Cases**: Consider empty lists, single-node lists, and cyclic lists.
- **Pointers**: Always check for null pointers to avoid errors.
- **Time Complexity**: Optimize traversal to `O(n)` where possible.
- **Debugging**: Print node values at each step to trace logic.
